# Console Playwright Test

This project demonstrates how to set up and use Playwright with Python, pytest, and Dynaconf.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:akhil-jha/console-playwright-test.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd console-playwright-test
    pip install .
    ```

3. Install Playwright dependencies:
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

## Usage

Before running the tests, make sure to set up the required environment variables in a `.env` file.

### Example `.env` file:

```bash
DYNACONF_BASE_URL=<your_base_url>
DYNACONF_USERNAME=<your_username>
DYNACONF_PASSWORD=<your_password>
```

After setting the environment variables, you can run the tests with the following command:
```bash
pytest -sv --headed
```

Options:

`-sv`: Run tests with extra verbosity.

`--headed`: Run the browser in headed mode (with UI). Remove this flag to run in headless mode.
